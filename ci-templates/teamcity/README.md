# TeamCity Configuration Templates for Scantist Security Scanning
Please refer to 
1. project devsecops-demo/.teamcity.yml for reference
2. the local .teamcity.yml

Since teamcity focuses more on paid and onprem senarios, and it undergoes a major update during 2025 (from settings.kts to .teamcity.yml), we current do not have template support for it.

We should copy the content in the local .teamcity.yml to a target project's .teamcity.yml
